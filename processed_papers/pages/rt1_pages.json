    "text": " \n \n Preprint \n \n \n \n 2 RELATED WORK \n \n \n A number of recent works have proposed Transformer-based policies for robotic control. As in\n RT-1, several works use language commands processed with Transformers as a robust framework\n for specifying and generalizing to new tasks (Zhang & Chai, 2021; Pashevich et al., 2021; Silva\n et al., 2021; Jang et al., 2021; Ahn et al., 2022; Nair et al., 2022). Our work takes the application\n of Transformersastepfurtherandtreatsthemappingoflanguageandvisionobservationstorobot\n actions as a sequence modelling problem, using a Transformer to learn this mapping. This idea\n is directly inspired by successes in game-playing (Chen et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2022 a) as well\n as simulated robot navigation (Fang et al., 2019), locomotion (Janner et al., 2021; Gupta et al.,\n 2022),andmanipulation(Jiangetal.,2022)environments. Wenotethatseveraloftheseworksgo\n beyond only text conditioning and use Transformers to also generalize across robot morphologies\n (e.g.,Guptaetal.(2022))andothermodalitiesfortaskspecifications(e.g.,Jangetal.(2021);Jiang\n etal.(2022)). Theseextensionsarepromisingfuturedirectionsfor RT-1. \n Beyond Transformer-basedpolicies,thefocusofourworkisongeneralizableandrobustreal-world\n roboticmanipulationatscale.Existingworksonreal-world Transformer-basedroboticmanipulation\n focus on efficiently learning tasks from a set of demonstrations per task (Shridhar et al., 2022).\n Behavior Transformer (Shafiullah et al., 2022) and Gato (Reed et al., 2022) advocate for training\n a single model on large-scale robotic and non-robotic datasets. However, these works are limited\n intheirreal-worldrobotictasks;e.g.,Gatolearnseffectivelyasingletask(coloredblockstacking)\n withoutevaluatinggeneralizationtonewtasksoravarietyofreal-worldsettings. Onthetechnical\n side,ourworkexamineshow Transformer-basedpoliciescanbebuiltsoastocombinehighcapacity\n andgeneralizationwiththecomputationalefficiencynecessaryforreal-timecontrol.\n Whiletheuseofhigh-capacity Transformermodelstolearnroboticcontrolpoliciesisafairlyrecent\n innovation, robotics has a long history of multi-task and language-conditioned learning, and RT-1\n buildsonthesefoundations. Asignificantbodyofworkdealswithlearningpoliciesandpredictive\n models for robotic grasping (Saxena et al., 2006; Lenz et al., 2015; Pinto & Gupta, 2016; Gupta\n et al., 2018; Viereck et al., 2017), with the aim of generalizing to new objects. Prior works have\n sought to address robotic language understanding through pipelined approaches that combine lan-\n guageparsing,vision,androboticcontrol(Mac Mahonetal.,2006;Kollaretal.,2010;Tellexetal.,\n 2011)andwithend-to-endapproaches(Meietal.,2016;Stepputtisetal.,2020;Lynch&Sermanet,\n 2020;Ahnetal.,2022). Multi-taskroboticlearninghasalsobeenapproachedfromtheperspective\n of learning to reach goals (Chung et al., 2015; Raffin et al., 2019; Jurgenson et al., 2020; Huang\n etal.,2020), aswellaslearningpoliciesthatcanperformtasksinadiscretesetorsomeotherpa-\n rameterizedform(Deisenrothetal.,2014;Devinetal.,2017;Foxetal.,2019;Kalashnikovetal.,\n 2021 a).

To accomplish this, we introduce a fixed-time waiting\n mechanismthatwaitsacertainamountoftime(280 ms,themaxobservedlatencyofallcomponents)\n afterthestate,thatwasusedtocomputethenextaction,hasbeencaptured,butbeforeapplyingthe\n action,similarlytotheproceduredescribedby Xiaoetal.(2020). \n C.2 DATACOLLECTIONATSCALE. \n \n Each of the robots autonomously approaches its station at the beginning of the episode and com-\n municates to the operator the instruction that they should demonstrate to the robot. To ensure a\n balanced dataset as well as randomization of the scene, we created a software module responsible\n for sampling the instructions to be demonstrated as well as the randomization of the background\n configuration. Each of the robots tells the demonstrator how to randomize the scene and which\n instructiontodemonstrate. \n Demonstrations are collected with direct line-of-sight between operator and robot using 2 virtual\n reality remotes. We map remote controls onto our policy action space to preserve consistency of\n thetransition-dynamics. 3 Dpositionandrotationaldisplacementsoftheremotearemappedto 6 d\n displacementsoftherobottool.

First,Image Netpretraining(alongwith Universal Sentence\n Encoder language embedding) has a large impact particularly on unseen tasks. We observe that\n RT-1 inherits some of the knowledge that results from the generality and diversity of the datasets\n thesemodelsweretrainedon. Second,continuousactionshavealargeimpactacrossallaspectsof\n performance. This has been previously observed and may be due to the ability to represent more\n complexactiondistributions–theper-dimensiondiscretizationallowsourmodeltorepresentcom-\n plexmulti-modaldistributions,whilethe Gaussiandistributioncapturesonlyasinglemode. Third,\n given such expressive multitask models, data diversity has a larger impact than data size. Indeed,\n even datasets collected in simulated environments or from different robotic embodiments can be\n leveragedby RT-1,openingavenuesfornewregimesofdatacollection. \n Finally,RT-1 fuseslanguageintotheimagepipelineearlyvia Fi LMconditioning,comparedtoe.g.,\n Gato’slatefusion.
